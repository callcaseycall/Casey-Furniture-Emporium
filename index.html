          The Showtime Royal Chair is a modern masterpiece that combines natural
          materials with contemporary design. Crafted with a plywood frame, it
          features a rattan veneer where strips of rattan and coco twigs are
          meticulously inlaid side by side, creating dynamic swirls and curves
          that offer both movement and dimension. The veneer is sanded and
          coated with resin, resulting in a lustrous finish that enhances its
          sculptural appeal. This statement piece is ideal for making a bold
          impression in an entryway or serving as a focal point in a long
          corridor.
